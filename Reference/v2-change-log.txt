Version 2.0
===========

----------------
09-09-12 Release
----------------

Fixed a few minor errors in the text. Updated the number of benchmarks.

Significant changes with respect to the previous release:

- Clarified the role of sort, function and let variable definitions
  with respect to the language of a logic (see Section 3.8).


----------------
21-12-10 Release
----------------

Another minor release, fixing a number errors, clarifying the text in
a few points, and adjusting the standard in minor ways.

Significant changes with respect to the previous release:

- Clarified and generalized the definition of string literals. For
  generality the standard defines only two escape sequences: \" and \\ .
  The first is used as usual to allow the double quote character to appear 
  in a string literal, the second to allow a string literal to end with
  backslash.
  There only two escape sequences for achieve maximum generality in the 
  SMT-LIB standard and independence from programming language conventions.
  In particular, and contrary to most programming languages, \n and \012, 
  say, are not escape sequences denoting the new line character but
  regular sequences of characters denoting themselves. Future SMT-LIB
  theories of strings that use string literals as constant symbols will 
  have the liberty to define certain string constants, such as "\n"
  and "\012", as equivalent (or not).

- The argument of set-logic can refer to *any* logic supported by a solver
  including logics not in the official SMT-LIB catalog.

- Specified more precisely which commands can be called and which options 
  can be set  before set-logic.

- Specified more precisely the expected solver behavior for unsupported
  commands.

- Clarified the role of set-info invocations.


----------------
28-08-10 Release
----------------

This is a minor release, fixing a number errors, clarifying the text in
a few points, and adjusting the standard in minor ways.

Significant changes with respect to the previous release:

- Fixed the text at the beginning of Section 3.1 which specifies the 
  legal character set (ASCII) and clarifies the definition and lexical 
  role of comments.
  
- Quoted symbols, i.e., vertical-bar-delimited symbols, cannot contain 
  the backslash character (\) anymore. (This is for simplicity.)

- Clarified that enclosing a symbol in vertical bars does not produce 
  a new symbol. For instance, |xyz| is the same as xyz.

- The notion of *reserved word* has been introduced. Reserved words are

    par  NUMERAL  DECIMAL  STRING  _  !  as  let  forall  exists

  as well as each command name. The syntactic category <symbol> now 
  explicitly excludes all the reserved words.

- In the concrete grammar the proof production of <attribute> has changed
  from
  <attribute> ::= <keyword> | <keyword> <s_expr>
  to
  <attribute> ::= <keyword> | <keyword> <attribute_value>
  the originally intended one.

- Added a new theory function symbol annotation called :pairwise
  for function symbols of rank (s s Bool) for some sort s.
  If f is declared with :pairwise then (f x1 x2 x3 x4) is syntactic sugar for
  (and (f x1 x2) (f x1 x3) (f x1 x4)
                 (f x2 x3) (f x2 x4)
                           (f x3 x4)).
  
- Eliminated 'distinct' as a special construct. It is now a function symbol
  of the Core theory (like =, true, false, etc), declared with :pairwise.
