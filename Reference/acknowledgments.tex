\section*{Version 2.0}

Version 2.0 of the SMT-LIB standard was developed with the input of 
the whole SMT community and
three international work groups consisting of developers and users of SMT tools:
the SMT-API work group, led by A.~Stump,
the SMT-LOGIC work group, led by C.~Tinelli, and
the SMT-MODELS work group, led by C.~Barrett.
The Version 2.0 document was written by  C.~Barrett, A.~Stump and C.~Tinelli.
