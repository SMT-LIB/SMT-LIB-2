 "This is a theory of floating point numbers largely based on the IEEE standard 
  754-2008 for floating-point arithmetic (http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/754/) 
  but restricted to the binary case only.
  A major extension over 754-2008 is that the theory has a sort for every 
  possible exponent and significand length.

  Version 1 of the theory was based on proposal by P. Ruemmer and T. Wahl [RW10].
 
  [RW10] Philipp Ruemmer and Thomas Wahl.
         An SMT-LIB Theory of Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.
         Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on
         Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT'10), Edinburgh, UK, July 2010.
         (http://www.philipp.ruemmer.org/publications/smt-fpa.pdf)

  Version 2 was written by C. Tinelli using community feedback.
  Version 3, the current one, was written by C. Tinelli and M. Brain following
  further discussion within the SMT-LIB community, and then relaborated with 
  P. Ruemmer and T. Wahl.
  A more detailed description of this version together with the rationale of
  several models decisions as well as a formal semantics of the theory can be
  found in
  
  [BTRW15] Martin Brain, Cesare Tinelli, Philipp Ruemmer, and Thomas Wahl.

 :notes
 "Semantically, for each eb and sb, there is exactly one +infinity value and 
  exactly one -infinity value in the set denoted by (_ FloatingPoint eb sb), 
  in agreement with the IEEE 754-2008 standard.
  However, +/-infinity can have two representations in this theory. 
  E.g., +infinity for sort (_ FloatingPoint 2 3) is represented equivalently 
  by (_ +oo 2 3) and (fp #b0 #b11 #b00).

 :note
 "The +zero and -zero symbols are abbreviations for the corresponding fp literals.
  E.g.,   (_ +zero 2 4) abbreviates (fp #b0 #b00 #b000)
          (_ -zero 3 2) abbreviates (fp #b1 #b000 #b0)
 "

 ; Non-numbers
 :funs_description "All function symbols with declaration of the form

   ((_ NaN eb sb) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))

 :notes
 "For each eb and sb, there is exactly one NaN in the set denoted by 
  (_ FloatingPoint eb sb), in agreeement with Level 2 of IEEE 754-2008
  (floating-point data). There is no distinction in this theory between 
  a ``quiet'' and a ``signaling'' NaN.
  NaN has several representations, e.g.,(_ NaN eb sb) and any term of 
  the form (fp t #b1..1 s) where s is a binary containing at least a 1
  and t is either #b0 or #b1.

  This means for instance that the formula

; Semantics
;-----------

 :note 
 "The semantics of this theory is described somewhat informally here.
  A rigorous, self-contained specification can be found in [BTRW14]:
   'An Automatable Formal Semantics for IEEE-754 Floating-Point Arithmetic'
  and it takes precedence in the case of any (unintended) inconsistencies.
 "

 :definition 
 "For every expanded signature Sigma, the instance of FloatingPoints with 
  that signature is the theory consisting of all Sigma-models that satisfy
  the constraints detailed below.

  We use [[ _ ]] to denote the meaning of a sort or function symbol in 
  a given Sigma-model.


  o (_ FloatingPoint eb sb)

    [[(_ FloatingPoint eb sb)]] is the set of all the binary floating point
    numbers with eb bits for the exponent and sb bits for the significand,
    as defined by IEEE 754-2008. 

    Technically, [[(_ FloatingPoint eb sb)]] is the union of the set 
    {not_a_number} with four sets N, S, Z, I of bit-vector triples
    (corresponding to normal numbers, subnormal numbers, zeros and
    infinities) of the form (s, e, m) where s, e, and m correspond
    respectively to the sign, the exponent and the significand (see
    the paper for more details).
  
    Note that the (semantic) value not_a_number is shared across all
    [[(_ FloatingPoint eb sb)]].


  o (_ BitVec m), binary and hexadecimal constants

    These are interpreted as in the theory FixedSizeBitVectors.


  o Real

    [[Real]] is the set of real numbers.


  o RoundingMode

    [[RoundingMode]] is the set of the 5 rounding modes defined by IEEE 754-2008.


  o (roundNearestTiesToEven RoundingMode), (roundNearestTiesToAway RoundingMode), ...

    [[roundNearestTiesToEven]], [[roundNearestTiesToAway]], [[roundTowardPositive]], 
    [[roundTowardNegative]], and [[roundTowardZero]] are the 5 distinct elements 
    of [[RoundingMode]], and each corresponds to the rounding mode suggested by
    the symbol's name.


  o (RNE RoundingMode), (RNA RoundingMode), ...

    [[RNE]] = [[roundNearestTiesToEven]];
    [[RNA]] = [[roundNearestTiesToAway]];
    [[RTP]] = [[roundTowardPositive]];
    [[RTN]] = [[roundTowardNegative]];
    [[RTZ]] = [[roundTowardZero]].
    
  
  o (fp (_ BitVec 1) (_ BitVec eb) (_ BitVec i) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))

    [[fp]] returns the element of [[(_ FloatingPoint eb sb)]] whose IEEE 754-2008 
    binary encoding matches the input bit strings:
    for all bitvectors 
    b1 in [[(_ BitVec 1)]], b2 in [[(_ BitVec eb)]] and b3 in [[(_ BitVec i)]],
    [[fp]](b1, b2 ,b3) is the binary floating point number encoded in the IEEE 
    754-2008 standard with sign bit b1, exponent bits b2, and significant bit b3
    (with 1 hidden bit).

    Note that not_a_number can be denoted with fp terms as well. For instance, in
    (_ FloatingPoint 2 2),
    [[(_ NaN 2 2)]] = [[fp]]([[#b0]], [[#b11]], [[#b1]])
                    = [[fp]]([[#b1]], [[#b11]], [[#b1]])
  
    Similarly,
    [[(_ +oo 2 2)]] = [[fp]]([[#b0]], [[#b11]], [[#b0]])
    [[(_ -oo 2 2)]] = [[fp]]([[#b1]], [[#b11]], [[#b0]])
 

  o ((_ +oo eb sb) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))
    ((_ -oo eb sb) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))
    ((_ NaN eb sb) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))
    ((_ +zero eb sb) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))
    ((_ -zero eb sb) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))

    [[(_ +oo eb sb)]] is +infinity
    [[(_ -oo eb sb)]] is -infinity
    [[(_ NaN eb sb)]] is not_a_number
    [[(_ +zero eb sb)]] is [[fp]]([[#b0]], [[#b0..0]], [[#b0..0]]) where 
                           the first bitvector literal has eb 0s and
                           the second has sb - 1 0s  
    [[(_ -zero eb sb)]] is [[fp]]([[#b1]], [[#b0..0]], [[#b0..0]]) where
                           the first bitvector literal has eb 0s and
                           the second has sb - 1 0s  


  o ((_ to_fp eb sb) (_ BitVec m) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))
  
    [[(_ to_fp eb sb)]](b) = [[fp]](b[m-1:m-1], b[eb+sb-1:sb], b[sb-1:0]) 
    where b[p:q] denotes the subvector of bitvector b between positions p and q.


  o (fp.to_real (_ FloatingPoint eb sb) Real)

    [[fp.to_real]](x) is the real number represented by x if x is not in 
    {-infinity, -infinity, not_a_number}. Otherwise, it is unspecified.


  o ((_ to_fp eb sb) RoundingMode (_ FloatingPoint m n) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))

    [[(_ to_fp eb sb)]](r, x) = x if x in {+infinity, -infinity, not_a_number}.

    small to be represented as a finite number of [[(_ FloatingPoint eb sb)]];
    [[(_ to_fp eb sb)]](r, x) = y otherwise, where y is the finite number 
    such that [[fp.to_real]](y) is closest to [[fp.to_real]](x) according to
    rounding mode r.
  

  o ((_ to_fp eb sb) RoundingMode Real (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))

    [[(_ to_fp eb sb)]](r, x) = +/-infinity if x is too large/too small 
    to be represented as a finite number of [[(_ FloatingPoint eb sb)]];
    [[(_ to_fp eb sb)]](r, x) = y otherwise, where y is the finite number 
    such that [[fp.to_real]](y) is closest to x according to rounding mode r.


  o ((_ to_fp eb sb) RoundingMode (_ BitVec m) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))

    Let b in [[(_ BitVec m)]] and let n be the signed integer represented by b 
    (in 2's complement format).
    [[(_ to_fp eb sb)]](r, b) = +/-infinity if n is too large/too small to be 
    represented as a finite number of [[(_ FloatingPoint eb sb)]];
    [[(_ to_fp eb sb)]](r, x) = y otherwise, where y is the finite number 
    such that [[fp.to_real]](y) is closest to n according to rounding mode r.

    
  o ((_ to_fp_unsigned eb sb) RoundingMode (_ BitVec m) (_ FloatingPoint eb sb))

    Let b in [[(_ BitVec m)]] and let n be the unsigned integer represented by b.
    [[(_ to_fp_unsigned eb sb)]](r, x) = +infinity if n is too large to be
    represented as a finite number of [[(_ FloatingPoint eb sb)]];
    [[(_ to_fp_unsigned eb sb)]](r, x) = y otherwise, where y is the finite number
    such that [[fp.to_real]](y) is closest to n according to rounding mode r.

    
  o ((_ fp.to_ubv m) RoundingMode (_ FloatingPoint eb sb) (_ BitVec m))

    [[(_ fp.to_ubv m)]](r, x) = b if the unsigned integer n represented by b is 
    the closest integer according to rounding mode r to the real number 
    represented by x, and n is in the range [0, 2^m - 1].
    [[(_ fp.to_ubv m)]](r, x) is unspecified in all other cases (including when
    x is in {-infinity, -infinity, not_a_number}).


  o ((_ fp.to_sbv m) RoundingMode (_ FloatingPoint eb sb) (_ BitVec m))

    [[(_ fp.to_sbv m)]](r, x) = b if the signed integer n represented by b
    (in 2's complement format) is the closest integer according to rounding mode
    r to the real number represented by x, and n is in the range
    [-2^{m-1}, 2^{m-1} - 1].
    [[(_ fp.to_sbv m)]](r, x) is unspecified in all other cases (including when
    x is in {-infinity, -infinity, not_a_number}).
