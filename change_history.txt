  Theories/UnicodeStrings.smt2
    Fixed an example in Strings constant definition.

2020-05-20
  Logics/QF_BV.smt2
    bvxnor is no longer marked as left associative, as that is
    inconsistent with its meaning as the negation of bvxor.
  Theories/FixedSizeBitVectors.smt2
    Fixed minor typo

2020-02-09
  Theories/UnicodeStrings.smt2
    Mostly layout fixes in UnicodeStrings

2020-02-01
  Theories/UnicodeStrings.smt2
    To stable version.  Comments are fixed.  A few functions are added.

2019-05-07
  Theories/UnicodeStrings.smt2
    Draft 2.1
    Fixed a few typos in UnicodeStrings and changed names from hyphen
    (e.g. str.to-int) to underscore (str.to_int)

2019-04-17
  Theories/UnicodeStrings.smt2
    Draft 2.0
    Taking into account some of the feedback from the SMT-LIB community.
    In particular, with respect to Draft 1.0 character sort (Char) does not
    exists anymore, as this was considered to have more cons than pros.

2018-04-24
  Theories/UnicodeStrings.smt2
    First draft (Draft 1.0) for the theory of Unicode Strings and Languages

2017-11-24:
  Theories/Reals_Ints.smt2:
    Added abstract values for irrational numbers to set of Real values,
    consistently with the Reals theory (the omission of such values
    was an oversight).

  Standard reference:
    Standard reference updated to 2.6

2017-06-13:
  Logics/QF_BV.smt2:
    Added that bvxor and bvxnor are left associative
  Theories/FixedSizeBitVectors.smt2:
    Added :left-assoc attribute to bvand, bvor, bvadd, bvmul

2017-05-08:
  Theories/Reals.smt2:
    Fixed error in note on intepretation of (/t 0). 

2017-05-03:
  Logics/QF_BV.smt2:
    Updated to Version 2.6.  Division and remainder operations are no
    longer undefiend when the second operand is 0.  See
    the FixedSizeBitVectors theory definition for details.
  Theories/FixedSizeBitVectors.smt2:
    Updated to version 2.6; changed semantics of division and
    remainder operators.

    Minor formatting of notes fields.
  Theories/Reals.smt2:
    Minor formatting of notes fields.
